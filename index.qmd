## So, you want to make a research software package {.center}

::: {.fragment}
How do you persuade others to **use** it and **contribute** to it?
:::

## Practices that build trust

::: {.incremental}
1. Define your software's **mission and scope**.
2. Make a reasonable **first release** and **follow it up** consistently.
3. Embrace **radically open communication**.

## Scoping out your project

How do researchers do it for scientific projects?

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- Write an **abstract** before you even start!
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
- It's not your destination, it's a **compass**.

## How about software abstracts?

::: {.fragment}
**mission statement:** single-sentence, high-level.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Followed by one or more of the following:

- Specific aims
- Scope (features)
- Design principles

In the early days of **movement**, [Mikkel Roald-Arbøl](https://roald-arboel.com) reached out to us with [this message](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406001-Movement/topic/R.20Implementation/near/454864499):

::: {.fragment}
> Hi everyone!
> 
> **I've followed the project from the side-lines** for a few months now, ... I have over the past few years been curating **a similar package for R**, ... **functionality seems to overlap**, ... **Would be great to have someone to work together** with on which features are useful, what are best practices, etc. and **have packages for both Python and R**.
:::

## The perks of a having abstract

Do it **publicly** and **up-front**.

::: {.incremental}
- You sharpen your vision. :fist:
- You invite collaboration and scrutiny early. :hugs:
- In disagreements, you have something to point to. :compass:

## Your first release

Our team's check-list for a **minimum viable product (MVP)**:

::: {.fragment}
1. The software contains at least one useful feature.
2. That feature is well documented, incl. usage examples.
3. The software installs seamlessly on target platforms.
:::

## One feature is all you need

::: {.incremental}
- Keeps you focused on a concrete milestone :checkered_flag:
- Won't be perceived as trivial if you've clearly articulated your mission and scope :wink:
- Goal is to reach a few early adopters fast :dart:
:::

## Seamless installation is crucial

You don't get a second chance at making a first impression.

::: {.incremental}
- It's hard: **dependency hell** is called that for a reason.
- Manage expectations up-front.
:::

## Subsequent releases

::: {.fragment}
Rinse and repeat:

1. Release a few features at a time.
2. Avoid releasing undocumented features.
3. Make sure you don't unknowingly break existing functionality.
:::

## Incremental releases rock :metal: {.smaller}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
*For your team:*

- Easier course-correction
- Small wins to keep morale high
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
*For your users:*

- Can adapt their workflows gradually 
- Clear release notes are essential!
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
*For the ecosystem:*

- Predictability is currency. 
- Respect your neighbours.

## Use issues as a scratchpad

::: {.incremental}
- If you get a new idea, *write an issue*.
- If you get new info on an idea, *comment on the issue*.
- If an idea bursts its banks, *break it into smaller issues*.
- If two ideas are related, *cross-link the issues*.
- If an idea is no longer relevant, *close the issue*.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip}
If you can formulate it as a sentence, it's ready to be written down.

## Where would you post an issue? {.smaller}

:::

## The perks of a *public* scratchpad

- Transparency builds trust.
- A lively issue tracker signals activity.
- Attracts like-minded people.
- Other people may solve your problems.

## Pull Requests

Make all changes through **publicly visible work.**

## Practices that build trust {.smaller}

## :memo: Write a software abstract

Carve out your place in the web consciously, openly and from the outset.

## :rocket: Release early, release often

The trust you build through consistent, predictable releases compounds over time—worth far more than the polish you sacrifice by not waiting for perfection.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :hugs: Embrace radically open communication

Write everything down. Make it public by default. Watch the magic happen.
