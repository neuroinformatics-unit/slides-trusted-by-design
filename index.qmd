## So, you want to make a research software package {.center}

::: {.fragment}
How do you persuade others to **use** it and **contribute** to it?
:::

## FOSS projects rise and fall on trust

Make your software **trusted by design**:

::: {.incremental}
1. Define your software's **mission and scope**.
2. Make a reasonable **first release** and **follow it up** consistently.
3. Embrace **radically open communication**.

## Scoping out your project

How do researchers do it for scientific projects?


::: {.incremental}
- Write an **abstract** before you even start!
- It's not your destination, it's a **compass**.

## How about software abstracts?

::: {.fragment}
**mission statement:** single-sentence, high-level.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Followed by one or more of the following:

- Specific aims
- Scope (features)
- Design principles

> *Deep learning methods for motion tracking have revolutionised a range of scientific disciplines*, from neuroscience and biomechanics, to conservation and ethology. *Tools such as DeepLabCut and SLEAP now allow researchers to track animal movements in videos* with remarkable accuracy, without requiring physical markers. However, *there is still a need for standardised, easy-to-use methods to process the tracks generated by these tools*.

## The perks of having an abstract {.smaller}

Let's look at some scenarios:

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :memo: While writing the abstract

- Either you discover there is no need :tada:
- Or you gain clarity of purpose :fist:
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :rocket:During the project's early days

- People grasp your project's essence. You attract suitable early adopters :rocket:
- Someone points you to their cool project. It looks similar to yours :thinking:
:::
:::

## A real-world example {.smaller}

In the early days of **movement**, [Mikkel Roald-Arbøl](https://roald-arboel.com) reached out to us with [this message](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406001-Movement/topic/R.20Implementation/near/454864499):

::: {.fragment}
> Hi everyone!
> 
> **I've followed the project from the side-lines** for a few months now, and really enjoy seeing this type of project with a community behind it. I have over the past few years been curating **a similar package for R**, but mostly for personal use. However, many of the ideas behind and much of the **functionality seems to overlap**, and I was wondering whether it could make sense to talk together about features and for me to adapt my package to `movement`? **Would be great to have someone to work together** with on which features are useful, what are best practices, etc. and **have packages for both Python and R**. (my package is currently named `anibehavr`, but I just checked, and `movement` is not taken as a project name on CRAN).

## Your first release

Out team's check-list for a **minimum viable product (MVP)**:

::: {.fragment}
1. The software contains at least one useful feature.
2. That feature is well documented, incl. usage examples.
3. The software installs seamlessly on target platforms.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
You can't have all three: built fast, easy to install, and feature-complete.
:::
:::

## One feature is all you need

::: {.incremental}
- Keeps you focused on a concrete milestone :checkered_flag:
- Won't be perceived as trivial if you've clearly articulated your mission and scope :wink:
- Goal is to reach a few early adopters fast :dart:
:::

## Seamless installation is crucial

You don't get a second chance at making a first impression.

::: {.incremental}
- It's hard: **dependency hell** is called that for a reason.
- Manage expectations up-front.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning}
Don't underestimate the amount of work between *works on my machine* and *works on every machine my target audience may use*.
:::
:::

## Subsequent releases

Rinse and repeat:

1. Release a few features at a time.
2. Avoid releasing undocumented features.
3. Make sure you don't unknowingly break existing functionality.

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip}
- Move in small, incremental steps and minimise surprises.
- Invest in automation.
:::
:::

## Incremental releases rock :metal: {.smaller}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
*For your team:*

- Easier course-correction
- Small wins to keep morale high
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
*For your users:*

- Can adapt their workflows gradually 
- Clear release notes are essential!
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
*For the ecosystem:*

- Predictability is currency. 
- Respect your neighbours.

## Issues as a public scratchpad {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- If you get a new idea, **write an issue**.
- If you learn something new about an existing idea, **comment on the issue**.
- If an idea grows to burst its banks, **break it into smaller issues**.
- If two ideas are related, **cross-link the issues**.
- If an idea is no longer relevant, **close the issue**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip}
If you can formulate it as a sentence, it's ready to be written down.
:::
:::

*Why written?*

- I forget, you forget, everybody forgets.
- Never run out of things to work on.
- Your sharpen your writing, and thinking.

## The perks of a public scratchpad

::: {.fragment}
*Why public?*

- Transparency builds trust and signals inclusivity.
- Attracks like-minded people.
- Other people solve your problems.
- Opportunity to model healthy norms.
:::

## Pull Requests

Make all changes through pull requests.

:::: {columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Lead by example.
- Creates a documented track record
- Allows for review.
- Every review is a chance to embody your norms.

## Scale your comms alongside your community

Insert image of movement/BrainGlobe communication channels.

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning}
Past a certain size, curating and managing all these channels
requires significant effort.
:::
:::

## Trust signals {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :memo: Write a software abstract
- You invite collaboration and scrutiny early.
- You show that you're building thoughtfully.
- In disagreements, you have something to point to.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :rocket: Release early, release often

The trust you build through consistent, predictable releases compounds over time—worth far more than the polish you sacrifice by not waiting for perfection.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## :hugging_face: Embrace radically open communication

- Write everything down. 
- Make it public by default.
- Watch the magic happen.
:::
:::

## The key takeaway

If you behave like a trustworthy project from the beginning, people will treat you like one, and help the project grow into what it promises to be.
