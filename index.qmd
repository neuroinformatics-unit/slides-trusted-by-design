## So, you want to make a research software package {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## What do I mean by that?

- An open-source reusable library or toolbox, designed to be installed on other researchers' computers.
- I will use *software*, *package*, *project* or *tool* interchangeably.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
How do you persuade others to

- use it
- contribute to it
- **trust it**?
:::

## How do you build trust?

Make your software **trusted by design** by:

::: {.incremental}
1. Defining your software's **mission and scope**.
2. Making a reasonable **first release** and **following it up** consistently.
3. Embracing **radically open communication**.

## Scoping out your project {.smaller}

How do researchers do it for scientific projects?

:::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.fragment}
- Write an **abstract** before you even start!
- It's not your destination, but it's a useful **compass**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
![Source: mitcommlab.mit.edu](img/abstract_formula.png){height="300px" fig-align="left"}
:::

::::

## How about software abstracts?

::: {.fragment}
**mission statement:** single-sentence, high-level description of the project's purpose.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Followed by one or more of the following:

- **Specific aims**
- **Scope**
- **Design principles**
:::


## Example: BrainGlobe

It starts with lot and lot of research...

## The perks of having an abstract {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Make your abstract **public from the start**, and reap the benefits.

Let's look at some scenarios throughout your project's lifecycle.
:::

*While writing the abstract:*

1. You discover that existing tools already cover your project's scope :tada:
2. Articulating the need in writing gives you clarity of purpose :fist:

*During the project's early days:*

3. People grasp your project's essence. You attract suitable early adopters :rocket:
4. Someone points you to their cool project. It looks similar to yours :thinking:

*During the project's mature phase:*

5. Someone requests a feature. Your written scope guides you :compass:
6. You disagree with a collaborator on implementation. Your design principles anchor you :anchor:
:::

## A real-world example {.smaller}

In the early days of **movement**, [Mikkel Roald-Arbøl](https://roald-arboel.com) reached out to us with [this message](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406001-Movement/topic/R.20Implementation/near/454864499):

::: {.fragment}
> Hi everyone!
> 
> **I've followed the project from the side-lines** for a few months now, and really enjoy seeing this type of project with a community behind it. I have over the past few years been curating **a similar package for R**, but mostly for personal use. However, many of the ideas behind and much of the **functionality seems to overlap**, and I was wondering whether it could make sense to talk together about features and for me to adapt my package to `movement`? **Would be great to have someone to work together** with on which features are useful, what are best practices, etc. and **have packages for both Python and R**. (my package is currently named `anibehavr`, but I just checked, and `movement` is not taken as a project name on CRAN).
:::

## Takeaways

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Now imagine these scenarios without a public abstract.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Your **software abstract** is a **trust signal**.

  - You invite collaboration and scrutiny early.
  - You show that you're building thoughtfully.
  - In disagreements, you have something to point to.

## Your first release

Out team's check-list for a **minimum viable product (MVP)**:

::: {.incremental}
1. The software contains at least one useful feature.
2. That feature is well documented, incl. usage examples.
3. The software installs seamlessly on target platforms.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
You can't have all three: built fast, easy to install, and feature-complete.
:::
:::

## Focus on a single useful feature

::: {.incremental}
- Keeps you focused on a concrete milestone :checkered_flag:
- Won't be perceived as trivial if you've clearly articulated your mission and scope :wink:
- Goal is to reach a few early adopters fast :dart:
:::

## Seemless installation is crucial

::: {.incremental}
- You don't get a second chance at making a first impression
- It's hard: *dependency hell* is called that for a reason
- Manage expectations and state supported systems up-front.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
Don't underestimate the amount of work between *works on my machine* and *works on every machine my target audience may use*.
:::
:::

## Subsequent releases

Rinse and repeat:

1. Release a few new features at a time;
2. Avoid releasing undocumented features;
3. Make sure you don't unknowingly break existing functionality.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Move in small, incremental steps and minimise surprises.
:::

## Incremental releases rock :metal: {.smaller}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
*For your team:*

- Easier course-correction
- Small wins to keep morale high
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
*For your users:*

- Can adapt their workflows gradually 
- Clear release notes are essential!
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
*For the ecosystem:*

- Predictability is currency. 
- Respect your neighbours.

## The takeaway {.center}

The trust you build through consistent, predictable releases compounds over time—worth far more than the polish you sacrifice by not waiting for perfection.
