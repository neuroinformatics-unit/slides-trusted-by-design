## So, you want to make a research software package {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## What do I mean by that?

- An open-source reusable library or toolbox, designed to be installed on other researchers' computers.
- I will use *software*, *package*, *project* or *tool* interchangeably.
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
How do you persuade others to

- use it
- contribute to it
- **trust it**?
:::

## How do you build trust?

You can make your software **trusted by design** by focusing on 3 key aspects:

::: {.incremental}
1. Defining your software's **mission and scope**.
2. Making a reasonable **first release** and **following it up** with consistency.
3. Embracing **radically open communication**.

## Scoping out your project {.smaller}

How do researchers do it for scientific projects?

:::: {layout-ncol=2}

::: {.fragment}
- Write an **abstract** before you even start!
- It's not your destination, but it's a useful **compass**.
:::

::: {.fragment}

::::

## How about software abstracts?

::: {.fragment}
**mission statement:** single-sentence, high-level description of the project's purpose.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Followed by one or more of the following:

- **Specific aims**
- **Scope**
- **Design principles**
:::

## Case study: movement

How did we come up with an abstract for [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev)?

It starts with lot and lot of research...

## The perks of having an abstract

::: {.callout-tip}
Have your abstract defined **publicly** and **from the start**
:::

::: {.incremental}
- How does that help with building trust?
- Let's look at concrete scenarios, inspired by real events.
:::

## While writing the abstract

::: {.incremental}
1. You discover that existing tools already cover your project's scope :tada:
2. The deeper you dig, the more you see a pressing need. Articulating it in writing gives you clarity of purpose :fist:
:::


## During the project's early days

::: {.incremental}
1. People grasp your project's essence at a glance. You attract the right attention and gain early adopters :rocket:
2. Someone reaches out and points you to their cool project. It seems quite similar to yours, but you'd missed it in your initial research; it happens :thinking:
:::

## A real-world example
In the early days of **movement**, [Mikkel Roald-Arbøl](https://roald-arboel.com) reached out to us with [this message](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/406001-Movement/topic/R.20Implementation/near/454864499):

> Hi everyone!
> 
> **I've followed the project from the side-lines** for a few months now, and really enjoy seeing this type of project with a community behind it. I have over the past few years been curating **a similar package for R**, but mostly for personal use. However, many of the ideas behind and much of the **functionality seems to overlap**, and I was wondering whether it could make sense to talk together about features and for me to adapt my package to `movement`? **Would be great to have someone to work together** with on which features are useful, what are best practices, etc. and **have packages for both Python and R**. (my package is currently named `anibehavr`, but I just checked, and `movement` is not taken as a project name on CRAN).
>
> I am currently in the final months of writing my PhD, but will have more time to work on it afterwards. :-)
>
> Cheers, Mikkel

## Throughout the project's lifecycle:

::: {.incremental}
5. Someone raises a GitHub issue requesting a feature. Your written scope guides you :compass:
6. You disagree with a collaborator on implementation. Your design principles anchor you :anchor:
:::

## Takeaways {.smaller}

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Now imagine these scenarios without a public abstract

- Misunderstandings are more likely to arise.
- Decisions that felt principled to you may look arbitrary to others—and that erodes trust.
:::

::: {.incremental}
Your **software abstract** is more than a planning document—it's a trust signal.

  - You invite collaboration and scrutiny early.
  - You show that you're building something thoughtfully
  - When disagreements arise, you have something to point to.

## Citing references

- To cite references, include them in the `references.bib` BibTeX file
and then use the syntax `[@citekey]` to cite them.
- For example, our preprint of the Blackcap brain atlas [@blackcap_preprint].
- You can preview the reference entry by hovering over the citation, cool!
